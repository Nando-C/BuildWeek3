# BuildWeek3
This week your team is in charge of building the LinkedIn App Backend.

Read carefully the instructions, divide them in tasks, weigth them and assign them.

Create a Trello board for the management.

Create the GitHub repo for the project and assign to everyone the right to push the code.



The project should use the following stack:



Mongo or Postgres ==> DB
ExpressJS ==> API
ReactJS ==> Frontend
NodeJS ==> Server
Use Mongoose or Sequelize/SQL
If you choose mongoose you can embed documents or use id's as ref to populate.
